# Postcovid targeted proteomics
Contains all data and scripts used in the targeted proteomic post-COVID-19 study (doi: ). In short, we performed targeted proteomics analysis using the Olink platform and systematically investigated circulating protein levels from 627 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 186 COVID-19 convalescent individuals and 61 healthy individuals separated into 3 independent cohorts. All the raw data and scripts used to analyse this data are available in this repository.
