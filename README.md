# Postcovid targeted proteomics
Contains all scripts used in the targeted proteomic post-COVID-19 study (doi: ). In short, we performed targeted proteomics analysis using the Olink platform and systematically investigated circulating protein levels from 350 COVID-19 hospitalized patients, 186 COVID-19 convalescent individuals and 61 healthy individuals separated into 3 independent cohorts.


#### Directories:
<ul>
<li><strong>R</strong>: R scripts used for analysis and to generate all figures</li>
<li><strong>Raw data</strong>: Raw targeted proteomics data as obtained from Olink, along with phenotypic descriptions of patients</li>
<li><strong>Data: </strong>Processed data, integrated to be comparable to the MHH cohort. Integration of different cohorts was performed according to instructions from Olink.</li>
</ul>
